      <p>
        I'm currently a student at the University of Michigan studying Computer
        Science. I am excited about opportunities to gain practical experience
        and contribute to a dynamic organization. I am eager to develop
        essential skills, including but not limited to teamwork, critical
        thinking, and problem-solving, while making a positive impact on the
        community.
